# ClimateViz
A Python project for visualizing climate data using interactive maps. It leverages libraries like Cartopy and ipyleaflet to display thermal anomalies and geographic locations.

# ClimateViz

A data visualization project that tells compelling climate stories based on scientific data from the US Greenhouse Gas Center. This project aims to educate the general audience about climate change and motivate action through engaging narratives and visualizations.

## Challenge Overview

The project addresses the challenge of transforming vast amounts of climate data into relatable stories that encourage understanding and action against climate change. Utilizing datasets from the US GHG Center, we develop narratives that explain significant climate phenomena, such as rising temperatures, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, and their socio-economic impacts.

## Objectives

- To create visualizations that help explain climate change phenomena.
- To develop a narrative that is both informative and engaging.
- To motivate audiences to take action based on scientific data.

## Features

- Interactive maps visualizing greenhouse gas emissions across different regions.
- Comparisons between greenhouse gas data and socioeconomic data.
- User-friendly visualizations that illustrate key climate change metrics.

## Dataset Used

The project utilizes the **VIIRS NOAA20 Thermal Anomalies** dataset from NASA GIBS. This dataset provides remote sensing imagery that identifies thermal anomalies detected by the VIIRS sensor aboard the NOAA-20 satellite. 

### Dataset Details
- **Source:** NASA GIBS (Global Imagery Browse Services)
- **Access URL:** [NASA GIBS WMS](https://gibs.earthdata.nasa.gov/wms/epsg4326/best/wms.cgi)
- **Description:** This dataset includes thermal anomalies that can be used to analyze climate-related events, such as wildfires or heatwaves.
